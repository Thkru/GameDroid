# Features
+Travel Test App for Phones and Tablets: see screenshots
+Android Studio 1.2.1.1 project
+tested on Nexus5 and Nexus7 (Genymotion Emulator)
+including custom controls, animations, intents and everything I think could be used as a showcase in this small task

# Focus
+cleanCode: small methods, good readability, no boilerplate- or hacked id
+stability: couldn't crash it a single time :)
+performance: quick UI loading, splashscreen to load data in background
+intuitivity: using common android controls (actionbar etc) the user already knows
+no bad practices: orientation lock, unnecessary caches
+nearly just best practices: no deprecated APIs or old paradigms
+not too many 3rd party libs: so there's still something left for you to judge :)
+checking for exceptions: i.e. disable call feature when user has no SIM

# Possible improvements
+Unit & UI test: I'm a friend of TDD
+more devices under tests
+better UX: unfortunately I didn't graphics to implement
+using material design of 5.0
+could have used recyclerView instead of ListFragment&Adapter
+using a database instead of sharedPrefs
+better distinction for layouts in orientations and scales
+using more libs (Butterknife, Dagger, Dart, Roboguice, GSon, Parceler, Retrofit and so on...)
+more localisation
+using startOf/endOf in RelativeLayout to spport RTL layouts
+extracting more styles for reusage
